# Records-store-data-base

This is the second work project in my Data structure course, the goal is to create an efficient data base using 
complex data structures.

The main data structures used in this exercise are:

1) Array of linked lists
2) Ranked tree
3) Heap
4) Union find

The data base saves information about known and new customers, tracks their monthly expenses and tracks the
inventory of new and old records.
